            Dance offers me something more than just the technical challenge found in rhythmic gymnastics; it includes an emotional and spiritual aspect that allows me to really feel myself and immerse myself into my surroundings. The way I feel when the music comes on and my body takes over is amazing and allows me to experience freedom from the stress and work of my daily life. Dance is more than just a hobby to me, it is a world where I feel belonged, a family where unbreakable bonds are created. Come join Columbia China Dance’s family!!!

Dance has always been there and I have made some of my longest lasting friendships through dancing.
